# Bug Fixes for Todo CLI Application

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. **Critical Logic Bug in `is_completed()` Method**
**Location**: `src/todo.rs:81-89`

**Problem**: 
- The method name `is_completed()` suggests it should check if a task is completed
- However, it was actually **marking** the task as completed (`task.set_completed()`)
- It always returned `true` if the task existed, regardless of actual completion status
- This was misleading and caused incorrect behavior

**Fix**:
- Split functionality into two methods:
  - `is_completed(&self, id: u32) -> bool`: Now properly checks completion status without modifying the task
  - `mark_task_completed(&mut self, id: u32) -> bool`: Handles marking tasks as completed
- Updated the method signature to take `&self` instead of `&mut self` for the check method

### 2. **Confusing User Experience in Mark Task as Completed**
**Location**: `src/main.rs:86-91`

**Problem**:
- The UI called `is_completed()` which actually marked the task as completed
- It printed "Task is completed: true/false" which was confusing
- Users couldn't tell if they were checking status or marking as completed

**Fix**:
- Updated to check if task is already completed first
- Provides clear feedback: "Task is already completed!" or "Task marked as completed successfully!"
- Added proper error handling for non-existent tasks

### 3. **Poor User Feedback in Delete Task**
**Location**: `src/todo.rs:71-79` and `src/main.rs:81-85`

**Problem**:
- `delete_task()` only deleted completed tasks but gave unclear error message
- Users weren't informed about the restriction
- No distinction between "task not found" and "task not completed"

**Fix**:
- Modified `delete_task()` to return a boolean indicating success
- Updated main.rs to provide specific feedback:
  - "Task deleted successfully!" for successful deletion
  - "Task found but not completed. Only completed tasks can be deleted." for incomplete tasks
  - "Task not found!" for non-existent tasks

### 4. **Improved Task Display**
**Location**: `src/todo.rs:23-26`

**Enhancement**:
- Added visual indicators for task completion status
- Tasks now display with ✓ for completed and ○ for incomplete
- Format: `[status] [id] - [title] - [description]`

### 5. **Access Visibility Issues**
**Location**: `src/todo.rs:5` and `src/todo.rs:34`

**Fix**:
- Made `Task.id` field public to allow access from main.rs
- Made `Todo.tasks` field public for task existence checks

## Testing
All fixes have been verified to compile successfully with `cargo build`. The application now provides:
- Clear separation between checking and marking task completion
- Better user feedback for all operations
- Visual indicators for task status
- Proper error handling and messaging

## Impact
These fixes resolve critical logic bugs and significantly improve the user experience by providing clear, accurate feedback for all operations.
